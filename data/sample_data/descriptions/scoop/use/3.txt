Household objects such as spoons, ladles, scoops, and measuring cups can be used to scoop objects. Spoons and ladles can be used to scoop dry or semi-solid objects such as flour, sugar, and oatmeal; while scoops and measuring cups are better for scooping wet or granular objects such as liquids like juice or grains like rice.
