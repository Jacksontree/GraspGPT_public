Household objects used to support the function of scooping typically include items such as spoons, ladles, scoops, and hands. These objects use the physics principles of leverage and friction to lift and move various materials such as food, liquids, and powders. Lifting an object and transferring it to a new location, as in 'scooping', can be achieved with verbs such as 'pick up' or 'remove'.
