Household objects that can be used to scoop include spoons, ladles, scoops, and shovels. These tools are generally made from either metal or plastic and can be used to transfer small or large amounts of items such as food or snow. Verbs such as 'grasp', 'pick up', or 'lift' can achieve similar conveying of the notion of scooping an object, as all these verbs denote the action of picking up and transporting something from one place to another.
