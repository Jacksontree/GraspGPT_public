Household objects which support the function of scooping typically have a handle with a wide, shallow bowl or spoon-like shape to collect and move a desired amount of material. Tools such as shovels or spades, certain kitchen utensils (e.g. ladles or skimmers), and even a cupped hand are all examples of objects which can be used for scooping.
