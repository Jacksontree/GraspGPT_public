Household objects that can be used to support the function of scooping include long-handled utensils such as spoons, slotted spoons, shovels, ladles, scoops and tongs. These objects are typically made of metal or plastic and have shapes that allow them to scoop materials, such as food, liquid or powder, and move them from one location to another.
