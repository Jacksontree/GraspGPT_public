Household objects that can be used to pour include pitchers, jugs, measuring cups, and spoons. These objects can help measure and control the amount of liquid being poured, providing a more detailed and accurate response. Verbs such as 'drain', 'discharge', 'eject', 'expel', and 'transfuse' all achieve similar effects to 'pour an object' by conveying the action of transferring a substance from a container to another.
