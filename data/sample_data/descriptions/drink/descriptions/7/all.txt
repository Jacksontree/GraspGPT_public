Household objects that support the function of drinking include cups, glasses, and mugs, which hold the liquid and enable it to be consumed, as well as straws and spoons, which help to direct the liquid into the mouth. Verbs such as "ingest" or "consume" may be used to describe activities similar to "drinking an object", focusing on the act of taking in the object by mouth and allowing it to pass through the digestive system.
