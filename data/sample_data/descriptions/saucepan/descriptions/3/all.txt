A saucepan typically has a slightly rounded base and sides that slope outward slightly, forming a semi-spherical or flared-cylinder shape with a dome-like lid. The saucepan is a rounded cooking vessel, typically with a handle, used to cook food over a heat source on the stovetop or in the oven. It is ideal for simmering, boiling and slow-cooking dishes like stocks, soups, and sauces. A saucepan typically has a cylindrical body with a handle on one side and a lid on the other that is conical, so other household objects that have similar geometries would be items like tubes of shaving cream or toothpaste, a pot lid, or a can of soup which all have cylindrical, conical, and cylindrical-with-handle geometries. A saucepan is a common kitchen utensil primarily used for boiling liquids and reheating food. Household objects with similar uses include the stockpot, which is often larger and deeper than a saucepan, and the Dutch oven, which is usually a deep, round pot with a lid and two handles.
