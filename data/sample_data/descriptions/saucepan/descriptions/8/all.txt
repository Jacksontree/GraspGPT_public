The saucepan has a roughly cylindrical shape, with a slightly curved lip at the top creating an open circumference at the top. The base of the saucepan is usually flat and slightly concave, allowing it to sit flat on a stovetop. A saucepan is a round and deep cooking vessel used to heat liquids and cook food at low to moderate temperatures. It is commonly used to simmer, sauté, and braise ingredients, as well as to make sauces and other dishes. A saucepan has a rounded base with straight angled walls, much like a cylindrical container such as a tin can or a coffee mug. It also has a handle that attaches to one side, similar to a shallow pot or pan. Household objects with similar uses to a saucepan include pots as they can both be used for boiling, simmering, and deep-frying food, as well as frying pans which are mainly used for sautéing and cooking small food items.
