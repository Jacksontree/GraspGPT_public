The saucepan has a roughly cylindrical shape, with a slightly curved lip at the top creating an open circumference at the top. The base of the saucepan is usually flat and slightly concave, allowing it to sit flat on a stovetop. A saucepan is a deep, circular container with a handle used for cooking and serving food over a heat source. It is often accompanied by a lid and used to boil, simmer, fry and roast various ingredients. The shape of a saucepan can be compared to that of a bowl or cup, with a round bottom, cylindrical walls, and a handle extending out from the side. Additionally, its profile can be similar to that of a teacup or mug, having a rounded indentation for gripping with a single handle extending out from one side. Saucepans are typically used for cooking or heating liquids. Objects that have similar uses include stockpots, Dutch ovens, double boilers, and frying pans. All of these items can be used to heat liquids and create different dishes, depending on the size and features of each item.
