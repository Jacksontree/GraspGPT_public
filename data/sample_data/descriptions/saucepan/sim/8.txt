A saucepan is a type of cooking vessel that has a tight-fitting lid, two handles, and a flat base which typically features grooves or radiating lines on the interior surface to aid in the even distribution of heat. In terms of similar household objects, a Dutch oven has a similar design but usually a larger size, and a frying pan typically has a flatter base with sloping sides and a single handle.
