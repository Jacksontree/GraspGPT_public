A saucepan is a shallow, round cooking vessel with a slightly flared rim, a long handle, and sometimes a lid, made of thin metal or other heat-resistant material. It is similar to other cooking vessels like the sauce pot, Dutch oven, and skillet, which all share common features such as a handle, lid, and round shape.
