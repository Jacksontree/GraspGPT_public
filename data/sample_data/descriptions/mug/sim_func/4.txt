A mug and a drinking glass have a similar function in that they both are used for holding liquid for consumption. However, a mug typically has a handle and is used for larger servings of liquids like coffee or tea, while a drinking glass is often stemless or stemmed and used for smaller servings of liquids like juices and water.
