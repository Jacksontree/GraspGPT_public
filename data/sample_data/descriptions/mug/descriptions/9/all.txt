A mug is generally shaped like a cylinder with either a curved or straight handle extending from one side to provide an easy grip. The top of the mug is typically not a perfect cylindrical shape, but rather curved inward slightly to help contain any liquid inside. Mugs are commonly used to drink hot beverages like coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and even soups. They are also often used as decorative items and collectibles. Mugs have a cylindrical geometry, with a base, a cylindrical side, and a curved top. Common household objects with a similar geometry include drinking glasses, vases, and cylinders such as paint cans or soda cans. Household objects that share similar uses to mugs are bowls, cups, and glasses. These objects can be used to consume liquid, such as water, coffee, tea, or juice. Additionally, they can all be used for storage purposes, such as holding snacks, candy, and other small items.
