A mug can typically be described as having a cylindrical shape, with a wide, flat bottom and a large handle that arcs along the side of the cylinder at its top. A mug is a vessel used to drink hot liquids such as tea, coffee, and hot cocoa. It is a type of cup typically with a handle and a wide mouth, made from materials such as ceramic, glass, plastic, or metal. Mugs have a cylindrical shape with a slight narrowing at the top, similar to the shape of many drinking glasses, cans, jars, and other household containers. Additionally, many mugs feature a handle which shares similar attributes to the handles found on plates, trays, and other containers. A mug and a drinking glass have a similar function in that they both are used for holding liquid for consumption. However, a mug typically has a handle and is used for larger servings of liquids like coffee or tea, while a drinking glass is often stemless or stemmed and used for smaller servings of liquids like juices and water.
