A mug can typically be described as having a cylindrical shape, with a wide, flat bottom and a large handle that arcs along the side of the cylinder at its top. A mug is a container typically used for drinking hot beverages such as coffee, tea, hot chocolate, or soup. It is typically cylindrical in shape, with a handle for gripping, and is often made of durable materials such as ceramic, stoneware, glass, or metal. The geometry of a mug can be compared to that of objects such as the neck of a bottle, a stein, a thermos, a vase, and a flowerpot - all of which have similar cylindrical shapes, curved edges, and handles. Household objects that have similar functions to mugs include any type of drinking vessel, such as cups, glasses, and tumblers, as they all provide a way to transport and drink liquids.
