The shape of a mug is cylindrical with a slightly inward sloping circumference and a flat, circular base. Mugs are typically used for containing hot drinks such as coffee and tea, and can also be used for other beverages such as hot chocolate and soup. A mug has a cylindrical body that is wider at the top and tapers toward the bottom. Household objects that share a similar shape are drinking glasses, vases, coffee cans, and jars. A mug shares a function in consuming liquid or other items such as food with many other objects in the household, such as glasses, tumblers and cups.
