A mug has a cylindrical shape, with a wide, flat base and a slightly tapered mouth. A mug is an object used to contain and transport hot and/or cold liquids, such as coffee, tea, and water. It typically has a handle to facilitate easy and safe handling, and often has a rim that helps contain the liquid and prevent spills. Mugs share similar geometrical features with cylinders, cones, and truncated cones in that they possess curved surfaces and straight edges, as well as a circular top. Additionally, certain mugs, such as those with handles, possess more complex geometric features, such as shapes that resemble a complex combination of several geometrical shapes, like a cylinder and a cone. Mugs and other household objects, such as glasses, jars, and other containers, can all be used to hold and contain liquids, such as hot or cold drinks. In addition, certain mugs, such as those with handles, can also be used to stir and mix drinks and other items.
