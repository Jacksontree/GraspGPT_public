A mug is a cylindrical container with a tapered outward-sloping curved sidewall and a flat bottom, commonly used for holding hot liquids. A mug is a cylindrical vessel used for holding and drinking hot or cold liquids such as coffee, tea, water, or other beverages. It typically has a handle and a wide opening that curves inward at the top, which allows a user to conveniently drink from the vessel without spilling. Mugs have rotating symmetries around their central axes, similar to other cylindrical objects like drinking glasses, cans, and even bottles. Their geometrical shape can be further characterized by the curved surface of their outward-facing sides, which is similar to the curved surfaces of other objects like bowls, vases, and lamps. Household objects that have a similar use to a mug include cups and glasses, which are used for holding liquids such as water and other beverages. They are typically made from heat-resistant materials to make them safe for hot liquids and also for frequent use.
