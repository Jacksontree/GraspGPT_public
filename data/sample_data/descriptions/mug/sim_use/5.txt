Household objects such as cups, glasses, and bowls can all be used for similar purposes to a mug, as all can hold and serve liquid items, such as coffee, tea, and water. They also share similar properties such as material (ceramic, glass, or plastic), shape (cylindrical or conic), size (tall or short), and pattern (solid, striped, etc.).
