Mugs share similar geometrical features with cylinders, cones, and truncated cones in that they possess curved surfaces and straight edges, as well as a circular top. Additionally, certain mugs, such as those with handles, possess more complex geometric features, such as shapes that resemble a complex combination of several geometrical shapes, like a cylinder and a cone.
