Mugs have rotating symmetries around their central axes, similar to other cylindrical objects like drinking glasses, cans, and even bottles. Their geometrical shape can be further characterized by the curved surface of their outward-facing sides, which is similar to the curved surfaces of other objects like bowls, vases, and lamps.
