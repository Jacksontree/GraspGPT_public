The spatula has a flat, elongated metal blade that curves at the handle end, forming a scoop-like shape that allows it to be used for scraping, flipping, and lifting. A spatula is commonly used in kitchens as a utensil for mixing, spreading, and lifting food items, such as flipping and maneuvering burgers or other items while cooking on a hot surface. Household objects that have similar shapes to a spatula include ice cream scoops and cake decorators; both consist of narrow, elongated handles and wide, flat heads that aid in scooping, lifting, or flipping objects. Household objects with similar uses to a spatula include a turner/fish slice and a slotted spoon, as all of these tools are used to scrape, flip, or serve food.
