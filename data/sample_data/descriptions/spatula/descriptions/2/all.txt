The spatula appears to have a handle of cylindrical shape with flat, truncated rhombohedral blade. The blade becomes increasingly thin near the distal tip, where the edges become sharp and curved. A spatula is most commonly used as a kitchen utensil to scrape, spread, and lift ingredients in cooking and baking. It can also be used to turn and flip food items such as pancakes, eggs, and burgers when cooking on a skillet or grill. Household objects that have similar geometries to a spatula include large spoons, ladles, and tongs. These objects also share a similar structure of two smooth flat surfaces connected to a central handle. A kitchen spoon or ladle can often perform similar functions to a spatula, such as stirring and flipping items. Some smaller cooking utensils, like a fish slice or turner, also provide functionality similar to a spatula.
