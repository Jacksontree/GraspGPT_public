The spatula has a flat, flexible blade with a usually rounded or tapered end, which is used to scoop items up or to spread material flat. A spatula is commonly used in kitchens as a utensil to mix, spread and lift food that is being cooked or served. It can also be used to scrape down the sides of mixing bowls or baking trays and to turn food when frying or grilling. Spatulas can be seen to share similar shape characteristics with flat metal blades such as kitchen knives, as well as with wooden stirring spoons and metal serving spoons. A kitchen spoon or ladle can often perform similar functions to a spatula, such as stirring and flipping items. Some smaller cooking utensils, like a fish slice or turner, also provide functionality similar to a spatula.
