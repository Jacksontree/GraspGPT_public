The spatula has a rigid handle extending from a flat, slightly flexible surface with an ergonomically curved end. The flat surface is typically slightly curved, tapering towards the curved end. A spatula is commonly used as a kitchen tool for scraping, stirring, flipping, and lifting cooked foods, such as pancakes and eggs, from a cooking surface to a plate. It can also be used to spread condiments and other food items, such as butter or peanut butter. A household ladle and a spoon may have similar shapes to a spatula, due to the elongated handle and flat edge at the end, although the spatula is typically wider than either of the other two utensils. A spatula is commonly used for mixing, scraping, folding, and flipping items such as food in the kitchen. Household objects with similar uses include a spoon, scraper, and spoonula (spoon-spatula hybrid).
