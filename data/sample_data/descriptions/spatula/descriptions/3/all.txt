The spatula is shaped like an elongated triangle, with one wider, flat surface used for spreading and scraping, and one arched surface used for reaching into tight spaces. A spatula is commonly used in kitchens as a utensil for mixing, spreading, and lifting food items, such as flipping and maneuvering burgers or other items while cooking on a hot surface. Household objects that have similar shapes to spatulas include paint scrapers and trowels, as both have a wide base and taper to a relatively sharp edge. A household object with a similar use to a spatula is a spoon. Spoons and spatulas both have a flat surface that can be used for serving and scooping food items. Additionally, both are used to mix and stir ingredients together in a pot or bowl.
