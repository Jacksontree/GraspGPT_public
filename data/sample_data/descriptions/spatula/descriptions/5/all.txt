The shape of a spatula is typically oblong and curved, with a handle of varying length and a flat and flexible blade that gradually tapers to a sharp point. The primary function of a spatula is to lift, turn, and scrape food as it cooks, as well as to serve food after cooking. It also functions as a tool for spreading and smoothing food products, such as batter and frosting, and can be used to mix or stir ingredients together. Household objects that have similar shapes to spatulas include trowels, serving spoons, and some types of fish-turners. They all share a wide, flat blade that can be used for scraping or scooping. Household objects with similar uses to a spatula include a turner/fish slice and a slotted spoon, as all of these tools are used to scrape, flip, or serve food.
