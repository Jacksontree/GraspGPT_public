The shape of a spatula is typically oblong and curved, with a handle of varying length and a flat and flexible blade that gradually tapers to a sharp point. A spatula is commonly used in the kitchen as a cooking utensil to stir, mix, and turn food items while cooking, as well as to help spread, lift, and cut food items. It is also used to spread frosting on cakes and other desserts. Household objects that have similar shapes to spatulas include paint scrapers and trowels, as both have a wide base and taper to a relatively sharp edge. Household objects that can perform similar functions to a spatula include a spoon or a spoon-like turner, a rubber-tipped/rubberized spoon, a fish flipper, or any other tool that has a flexible edge.
