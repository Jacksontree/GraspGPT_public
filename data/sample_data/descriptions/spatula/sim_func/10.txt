A household object that has a similar function to a spatula is a turner, which is designed with a flat edge and somewhat rounded shape to enable it to slide beneath and flip food items, typically those preparing to be cooked. Another household object with a similar function is a flipper, which is typically broader and more flexible than a turner and assists in transferring food items from one surface to another.
